# 📊 Handling Missing Data and Analyzing Data with Python

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to handle missing data and analyze a housing dataset using **Python** and **Pandas** on Kaggle. It showcases key data cleaning and analysis techniques, including loading data, managing missing values, and deriving insights such as average prices and filtered house details. This is a practical example of data preprocessing and analysis in a web-based data science environment.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Kaggle (Web-based Notebook Environment)

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Load and inspect a housing dataset
- Identify and handle missing values
- Verify the effectiveness of missing data handling
- Analyze data to extract specific insights (e.g., average price, price extremes, filtered houses)

---

## 📈 Results & Insights

- 🔍 **Missing Values Handled**: Missing values in 'Price' and 'Bedrooms' were filled with column means.
- 🔁 **Data Verification**: Post-processing checks confirmed no remaining missing values.
- 📊 **Analysis Insights**:
  - **Average Price**: Calculated as the mean of all house prices.
  - **Price Extremes**: Identified the house with the highest and lowest prices.
  - **Filtered Data**: Displayed houses with prices exceeding $600,000.
- 📌 **Business Impact**: This analysis provides a foundation for real estate market insights, aiding in pricing strategies and property evaluations.

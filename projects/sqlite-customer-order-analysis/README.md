## 🌟 Overview
This project demonstrates a practical application of SQLite to analyze customer and order data, focusing on data retrieval, table joins, and advanced querying. By identifying top-selling products and recent customer activity, it provides a solid foundation for business intelligence and database-driven decision-making. 📈

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Query Techniques**: JOIN, GROUP BY, SUBQUERIES
- **Platform**: SQLite Online Editor

## 🎯 Objectives
- Retrieve detailed customer and order information
- Perform joins to combine related tables
- Identify top-selling products using GROUP BY and HAVING
- Filter data with subqueries to find recent customer activity

## 📊 Results & Insights
- 🔍 **Data Retrieved**: Successfully fetched customer names, order IDs, and dates from joined tables.
- 📋 **Top Products**: Identified top-selling products using GROUP BY and ORDER BY (e.g., ProductID 55 with 25 units).

# 📊 Retrieve and Analyze Customer and Order Data with SQLite

## 📌 Overview
This project showcases my ability to retrieve and analyze customer and order data using **SQLite**, a lightweight relational database management system. It highlights essential SQL skills such as data retrieval, table joins, grouping, and subqueries to derive meaningful insights from a sample dataset. This is a foundational yet practical example of database-based data analytics.
